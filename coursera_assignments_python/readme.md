# [Assignment solutions for Dr. Chuck's Begginer Python course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python)  
Great course, recommend for everybody who's thinking to learn programming. Gave me a ton of confidience and inspiration to move forward in this field. These are some fundamental codes for beginners.  
Exercises with list, tuples, dictionaries, regex, working with i/o.

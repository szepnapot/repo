# PyHike
## side learning project
### started to code it while learned the basics of API and url request via Python.
Using Google's Geocode and Directions API with optional Wikipedia request.  
The goal is to write a simple program to help fellow travellers/hitchikers when they don't have proper  
interner connection, or just limited data usage. Currently making a GUI with Tkinter around it, then planning to   
work from the beginning again, and apply newly learnd things for the code.
